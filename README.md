# Perfect-Draw-Simulator
The simulator will be free to use and only contain assets found in the demo and the free card creation tool. 

This project is based on the work done by Nora Jean Haynes, Iris Cassandra, and the team at Double Summon Games.

There might be bugs and such in the future and I can not guarantee I am good enough at coding to maybe cause memory leaks or other crazy stuff. This meant as a passion project!
This project will be coded using Godot, but feel free to branch and use other game engines.
